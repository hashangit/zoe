## TUI & Interactive Experience (Interactive Mode)

In a TTY the CLI launches a full-screen Ink/React TUI (`src/adapters/cli/tui/`, lazy-loaded — headless/SDK/Server never import React/Ink/figlet). The readline REPL remains as the non-interactive fallback (`--no-interactive` / piped / `--docker`). The TUI renders via Ink `<Static>` + the terminal's native scrollback (no mouse capture → no gibberish; no alternate-screen buffer), with an Ink-internals reset (`ink-reset.ts`) for artifact-free resize/expand.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Bordered persistent input | The prompt row is wrapped in a rounded box and is always visible; during a run the spinner renders above it (not in place of it) and the input stays active. |
| `/` + `@` autocomplete | Fuzzy slash-command/skill dropdown (`/`) and project-file dropdown (`@`) floating above the input border; ↑/↓ navigate, Tab/Enter accept, multi-line via Shift+Enter. |
| Zoe Agent logo | A figlet "Zoe Agent" wordmark (`ANSI Compact`) with a Tokyo Night 45° rainbow gradient + `by hashangit · v…` descriptor; the first feed entry, scrolls away as you chat, re-seeded on `/clear`. |
| Persistent task panel | The `manage_todos` tool drives a persistent todo panel (status glyphs); the agent replaces the full list each call, and it survives session resume. |
| Streaming feed | Assistant responses stream token-by-token; tool calls render as live bordered blocks with streaming output; Markdown rendering for messages. |
| Inline write diffs | `write_file` renders a unified diff (green added / red removed, context-collapse) inside the tool block. Writes are atomic (same-dir temp + `fs.rename`), so a crash mid-write never corrupts the file; oversized writes skip the diff and show a plain summary. |
| Overlays | Command palette (Ctrl+P), model selector (`/models`), settings editor (`/settings`), session selector (`/sessions`), help (`/?`). |
| Session manager | List / resume / delete / rename / export (JSON) / transcript (Markdown) sessions; resume rebuilds the feed **and** the todo panel from persisted messages. |
| Message queue + `/steer` | Type during a run to queue follow-up messages; `/steer <msg>` interrupts the current run and redirects. |
| Live footer | Provider · model · context-window usage · cost · permission · skills · gateway status, updating live. |
| Tokyo Night theme | Consistent Tokyo Night Moon palette across all components from a single theme source. |
